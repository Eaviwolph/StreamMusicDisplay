# StreamMusicDisplay
Stream Music Display can be used to save in real time information about the song you are listening to in the format you need.
The format is configurable through the web page opened by default on **localhost:8888**.

## Goal
The ultimate goal is to make a small and configurable hard client that can be used to see continuously what song you are listening to.
